Problem Statement
    
Computers tend to store dates and times as single numbers which represent the number of seconds or milliseconds since a particular date. 
Your task in this problem is to write a method whatTime, which takes an int, seconds, representing the number of seconds since midnight 
on some day, and returns a string formatted as "<H>:<M>:<S>". Here, <H> represents the number of complete hours since midnight,
<M> represents the number of complete minutes since the last complete hour ended, and <S> represents the number of seconds since the 
last complete minute ended. Each of <H>, <M>, and <S> should be an integer, with no extra leading 0's. 
Thus, if seconds is 0, you should return "0:0:0", while if seconds is 3661, you should return "1:1:1".  */
